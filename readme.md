# PicoPass

A Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) proximity discovery system for Raspberry Pi Pico W devices.

## Features

- **Automatic Discovery**: Devices find each other without user intervention
- **Low Power**: Uses BLE for efficient battery operation
- **Visual Feedback**: LED flashes when another PicoPass device is detected
- **Burst Mode**: Rapid switching between advertising and scanning for optimal discovery

## How It Works

1. Each PicoPass device flickers back and forth between scanning and advertising rapidly.

2. The intervals are random and they go back and forth so fast they they will eventually overlap.

3. Devices only recognize others with the matching "PicoPass" identifier

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Pico W (with CYW43439 wireless chip)
- USB cable for programming and power
- Optional: External power source for portable operation

## Building

### Prerequisites
- [Pico SDK 2.2.0](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk/releases/tag/2.2.0)
- ARM GNU Toolchain (`gcc-arm-none-eabi`)
- CMake 3.13+

### Build Steps
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Will-Hellinger/picopass
cd picopass

cd picopass-pico

cmake -DPICO_BOARD=pico_w -DPICO_SDK_PATH=/path/to/pico-sdk -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=arm-none-eabi-gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/arm-none-eabi-g++ -B build -S .

cmake --build build -j
```

## Configuration

Key parameters in `main.c`:

```c
#define RSSI_THRESHOLD   -100    // Minimum signal strength for detection
static const uint8_t PICO_SECRET[8] = { 'P','I','C','O','P','A','S','S' };
```

- **RSSI_THRESHOLD**: Adjust detection range (This is subjective, it's based on resistance)
- **PICO_SECRET**: Change to create separate device groups

## Usage

1. **Flash** the firmware to multiple Pico W devices
2. **Power on** the devices
3. **Observe** LED flashes when devices detect each other
4. **Monitor** serial output (115200 baud) for detailed logs

## Serial Output

Connect to the device via USB serial to see detailed operation:
